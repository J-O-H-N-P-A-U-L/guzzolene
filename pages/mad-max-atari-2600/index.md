Hey everyone I just spent a few hours hacking this I call it Mad Max like the movie.

You are Mad Max driving in your black car after the creeps that ran over everyone you ever knew including your wife and baby daughter.

You were once an officer of the law but these creeps keep getting out and killing more people you are out to stop them from ever harming anyone else you are the Road Warrior!

They ride on their motor cycles towards you , you must run them down but watch out for the trucks if you hit too many trucks your car is destroyed and it's game over for you!

This is a work in progress right now. I am working on.

It is looking pretty nice, although I wish I could do big sprites like in Activision's Grand Prix.

How they did that I don't know there is a limit 8 pixels wide for sprites.

But still I did make everything look pretty good I think, just smaller than what I would like to have made.

The trucks look cool!

I need to find out how to get rid of some of the shaking of Max's car.

It is hard since I am working against formerly 6 frames of animation so it can be any of those or all of those together.

I do have it down though it is not shaking nearly as much as when I first did it, wow then it was blinking in different places that was bad!

It is nearly done and turned out pretty good but I am going to need to spend a lot of time on the words in the game and get them to say something about Max.
